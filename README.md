# Easy Proxxon MF70 conversion (WIP)

The [Proxxon MF70](https://www.proxxon.com/us/micromot/37110.php) is a cheap, tiny 3-axis mill that sells for around USD 400, sometimes much cheaper on Craigslist or eBay and is highly popular with hobbyists, especially for CNC conversions.

As it is a cheap machine, it has a number of shortcomings. I address only one of them here, which is the limited Y axis range of 46mm. In this conversion I extend it to 80+mm.

You will need a 3D printer that can print PETG or ABS.

### Why another MF70 conversion?

There are a number of kits on AliExpress to convert this machine, and while it's nice that they use metal parts, they do not address the Y axis limitation. There are a number of existing 3D printed DIY conversions out there, but I wasn't happy with any of their designs.

I wanted something that makes use of as much of the AliExpress metal kit as possible, extends the Y axis, and is easy to put together.

By the way, you can use this conversion if you just want extended Y range on a hand-operated mill and don't want the CNC. Just skip the parts marked (CNC only) below.

## Parts

I include McMaster links for all the parts below, if you want to order them all in one go. If you want to save money you can find similar parts on Amazon or eBay, though there is no way to permalink them.

### Extra hardware

## Instructions

Take apart the 2 axis stage

Run a standard M3 tap through the channels in the Y axis plate

Place the Y axis channel, verify the big square foo is able to run to both ends without obstruction. Note that the orientations MUST be correct, there is only 1 correct orientation of the Y axis channel and 1 correct orientation of  the big square foo. You may want to mark them for your convenience.

Remove the big square foo, clamp the Y axis channel and drill six 3mm holes through the channel and into the aluminum plate below.

Countersink the aluminum plate from the back.

Install the square nuts into the channel.

Install the big square foo (with the brass spacer) and channel.

Fix the channel with M3 12mm countersunk screws from the back.

Install the back plate with M3 15mm machine screws.

Install the front plate with M3 15mm machine screws (hand version) or M3 35mm screws (CNC version).

Install the threaded rod with thrust bearings on both front and back, and tighten the nylon locknut. Do not overtighten!

Put everything else back together. For the X and Z axis you can just use the AliExpress kit as-is.
